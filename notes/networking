IP Address = Internet Protocol Address

e.g. 192.168.101.13 (aka "dotted quad")
IP addresses correspond to a hostname (e.g. client-123 or cbc.ca)

IPv4 (IP Version 4): dotted quad
IPv6 (IP Version 6): longer address

"ifconfig" and "ip addr show" will show you your IP address

A computer has ports numbering to 65535
Ports are locations through which data can be sent or received

(IP addresses are like house addresses and ports are like house doors)

A socket is a "pipe" that connects to a port.
When a socket is being listened to, it blocks the port.

COMMON PORTS:
21/20	FTP		File Transfer Protocol
22 		SSH		Secure Shell
25		SMTP	Simple Mail Transport Protocol
53		DNS		Domain Name Server
80		HTTP	HyperText Transfer Protocol
443		HTTPS	HyperText Transfer Protocol encrypted with Secure Socket Layer

On Linux only root can use ports below 1024.

Data can be sent in two ways:
- TCP: Transmission Control Protocol
- UDP: User Datagram Protocol
TCP - reliable, slower
	- 3-way handshake: SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK
UDP - unreliable, fast, simple
	- "fire-and-forget" (does not keep track of packets)

# Python Data Values:
AF_INET = 2, AF_INET6 = 10
SOCK_STREAM = 1, SOCK_DGRAM = 2
SOL_SOCKET = 1
SO_REUSEADDR = 2
